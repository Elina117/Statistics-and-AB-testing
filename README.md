# Statistics and A/B Testing

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project focuses on the basics of **statistics** and **A/B testing**. It covers the theoretical foundations of statistical methods and the practical application of A/B testing techniques to compare different variations and evaluate their effectiveness.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
The project covers the following key topics:
- **Introduction to Statistics**:
  - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, etc.)
  - Probability distributions
  - Hypothesis testing (t-tests, z-tests, p-values)
- **A/B Testing**:
  - A/B test design and implementation
  - Hypothesis testing in A/B tests
  - Calculating statistical power and sample size
  - Interpreting A/B test results
- **AA Experiments**:
  - Purpose and methodology of AA experiments
  - Ensuring randomness and pre-test calibration
  - Analyzing AA test results to validate the correctness of A/B tests
